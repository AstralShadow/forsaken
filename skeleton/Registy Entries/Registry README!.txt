  To install to the default location simply click on the registry files.


Custom Install:

  If you would like to install to another location.

  Edit "app_paths.reg" and "direct_play.reg" and change the paths.

  At the moment they are set for "C:\\ProjectX".

  [Re]Install them by double clicking them.


Secondary Install:

  No changes are required.

  As long as the registry entries point to a valid installation.


Secondary Install: (Developers)

    There really is no need to worry about anything.

    Unless you are developing an external DirectPlay lobby application.

    Then you might want to create a full secondary install.

    You must change the paths including the name of the exe and the GUID.

    Note: You must change the GUID within the forsaken source as well.
