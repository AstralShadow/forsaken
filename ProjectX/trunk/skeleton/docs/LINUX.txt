== Linux Versions ==

	Binaries

		-static		Has most libraries built in (except sdl 1.2, opengl, openal)

		-debug		Debug symbols, profiling, no optimizations

		non debug	Built with optimizations and no debug info (BETA)

	Ubuntu 11.10 oneiric:

		sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev


== 64 Bit OS ==

	You need 32 bit lib's built including lua


== Mouse ==

	Linux commonly defaults to sending a middle click if both left/right buttons are clicked.

	You can disable three mouse button emulation in your Xorg configuration.

	A quick fix is to bind the middle button to the same actions as both mouse buttons.

	But then you loose the ability to use middle click on it's own if you have the button.


== Profiling ==

	To generate profiling output run, "gprof ./projectx-binary ./gmon.out > gmon.txt"


== Debugging ==

	Use gdb as you normally would:

		gdb --args ./projectx-debug ...
		r # to start
		bt # to backtrace

== Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 ==

    For joystick axis to work correctly:

    Add SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=/dev/input/js0 to /etc/environment and relogin.
    Then recalibrate (jscal -c /dev/input/js0).

    The settings will be lost on reboot unless you also save the calibration:
    Save with: jscal -p /dev/input/js0 > /etc/joystick.cal
    Add: source /etc/joystick.cal to /etc/bash.bashrc
