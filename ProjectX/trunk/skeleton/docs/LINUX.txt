	The static versions only require that you mainly have sdl, opengl and openal installed.


	Packages for the game:

		sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0 liblua5.1-0-dev liblua5.1-socket-dev liblua5.1-socket2 lua5.1 libsdl1.2-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev

	Commands to fix up the lua on ubuntu

		cd /usr/include
		ln -s lua5.1/ lua
		cd /usr/lib
		ln -s liblua5.1.so liblua.so
		ln -s liblua5.1.a liblua.a
		ln -s liblua5.1-mime.a liblua-mime.a
		ln -s liblua5.1-socket.a liblua-socket.a
		ln -s liblua5.1-unix.a liblua-unix.a

	Outdated ubuntu packages

		sudo apt-get install libenet libenet1-dev
		sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev

	Build them your self

		http://enet.bespin.org
		http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html

	OpenAL Build Process

			cd build
			cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
			make
			sudo make install

	Binaries

		The -static versions have more libraries built in rather than requiring you to have them installed.

		The NON -debug versions are built in RELEASE mode with optimizations.

		The -debug versions are built debug symbols, include profiling support and NO optimizations.

	Profiling

		To generate profiling output run, "gprof ./projectx-binary ./gmon.out > gmon.txt"

	64 Bit

                You need 32 bit lib's built including lua

                http://ch.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/lua5.1/liblua5.1-0_5.1.4-5_i386.deb

		Try the static version if all else fails

	3 button mouse emulation

		Linux commonly defaults to sending a middle click if both left/right mouse button are clicked together.
	
		You can disable three mouse button emulation in your Xorg configuration.

		A quick fix is to bind the middle button to the same actions as both mouse buttons.

                But then you loose the ability to use middle click on it's own if you have the button.
