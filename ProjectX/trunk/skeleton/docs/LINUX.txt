== Linux Versions ==

	Binaries

		-static		Has most libraries built in

		-debug		Debug symbols, profiling, no optimizations

		non debug	Built with optimizations and no debug info (BETA)


== Static Versions ==

	The static versions only require that you mainly have sdl, opengl and openal installed.

		sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev libopenal-dev


== Non Static Versions ==

	Binaries are compiled against Ubuntu 11.10 oneiric.

		sudo apt-get install \
				liblua5.1-0 liblua5.1-0-dev \
				liblua5.1-socket-dev liblua5.1-socket2 \
				zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev


== Building ==

	Since Ubuntu moved to enet 1.3 you must compile the 1.2 branch your self.

	Download the source from and follow the README file for compiling.

		http://enet.bespin.org  (1.2 series)


== Building (optional) ==

	Some people may chose to install latest OpenAL.

		http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html

	To build:

		cd build
		cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
		make
		sudo make install


== 64 Bit OS ==

	You need 32 bit lib's built including lua


== Mouse ==

	Linux commonly defaults to sending a middle click if both left/right buttons are clicked.

	You can disable three mouse button emulation in your Xorg configuration.

	A quick fix is to bind the middle button to the same actions as both mouse buttons.

	But then you loose the ability to use middle click on it's own if you have the button.


== Profiling ==

	To generate profiling output run, "gprof ./projectx-binary ./gmon.out > gmon.txt"


== Debugging ==

	Use gdb as you normally would:

		gdb --args ./projectx-debug ...
		r # to start
		bt # to backtrace
