If you get an error about OpenAl32.dll not being found then,
run aolinst.exe to install 32/64 bit libraries for OpenAL.

UPDATE:

You can always find the latest openal from: http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html

Rename soft_oal.dll to OpenAL32.dll and place it in the projectx folder!

Or wherever you run the exe from...
